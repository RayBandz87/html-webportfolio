<h1>The Best Movies According to Raymond</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Django: Unchained</h3>
<p>The movie is occasionally great but generally irritative. In the same masturbatory way that most Tarantino movies are good, this one is good.</p>
<h3>Harlem Nights</h3>
<p>"Harlem Nights" is a nice, enjoyable movie where Eddie Murphy doesn't overdo his street-smart shtick, where Pryor is the nice guy and occasionally a touching father figure who tries to keep things under control, and where Redd Foxx is the subject of a great running-gag involving his poor sight, his interactions with Della Reese are as enjoyable as Murphy's.</p>
<h3>Walk Hard: Dewy Cox Story</h3>
<p>Many tiny laughs are produced by the severe silliness that dominates most of Cox's life, but not enough memorable major moments are achieved.</p>
